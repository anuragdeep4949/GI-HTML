		    <p>In a garden there are only green pod and tall pea plants. After one generation there were plants which are both tall and dwarf with green and yellow pod appeared. After two generation most of the plants were tall with green pods while only 3 per cent plant had dwarf with yellow pod. In these plants only self pollination occurred and all plants produce viable seeds. The garden can't have more than 100 plants due to limited resources. Assuming that we are considering only one pod per plant.

			Question -

			What was the ratio of genotypes of plants at the beginning? Give an explanation with experimental setup of how it might have 			happened. You are required to test hypothesis in the following format (Lawson's flowchart) </p>

	      	<h3>Hypothetico-Deductive Reasoning</h3>
	      	<p> What do you mean by Hypothesis? <br/>
				A hypothesis is a possible explanation for an observation or problems that can further be tested by experimentation. <br/>
				What do you mean by Prediction? <br/>
				A prediction is a guess what might happen based on observation. <br/>
				What do you mean by Observation? <br/>
				Observation is the active acquisition of information from a primary source. <br/>
				What do you mean by conclusion? <br/>
				Conclusion is a summary of the experiment's results, and how those results match up to your hypothesis. <br/>
				What do you mean by dependent variable? <br/>
				have to create mcq	<br/>
				What do you mean by independent variable? <br/>
